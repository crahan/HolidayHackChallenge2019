## Introduction
Hi there! Welcome to my write-up of 2019's [SANS Holiday Hack Challenge](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2019/) aka [KringleCon 2: Turtle Doves](https://kringlecon.com). 

The menu at the top gets you to all the goodies. This page serves as a  summary for the main challenge answers, university map, and overall narrative. Challenges and hints can be found in their respective sections. Some odds and ends like interesting UI elements, login credentials, and a few notes about tokens are stored under miscellaneous. If you prefer keyboard shortcuts you can use `n` and `p` to navigate through all the content or use `s` to search.

All site content is generated from Markdown files using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and hosted using [Github](https://github.com/crahan/kringlecon2019) pages.

    *Talk to Santa in the Quad* and *Find the Turtle Doves* do not require any answers to be submitted as these objectives are there to set the stage, point you in the right direction, and ensure you visit all areas of Elf University. The write-up for both these objectives has been consolidated under a single entry titled [Talk to Santa & Find the Turtle Doves](./challenges/c1/).

## KringleCon 3: Jack Frost
After thwarting the Tooth Fairy's dastardly plans and meeting up with Santa and Krampus at the top of the Bell Tower at Elf University you'll find a letter in the back left corner of the room. It appears that the Tooth Fairy wasn't working alone! Could this be a hint for 2020? Will we be facing off with Jack Frost at KringleCon 3? *Cue the ominous music*.
