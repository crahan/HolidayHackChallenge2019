## Resources
- *"Green words matter, files must be found, and the terminal's $PATH matters."* 

## Solution
![Terminal](../img/hints/h4/h4_terminal1_hobo.png)

When running a command without specifying the full path, the OS uses the list of paths stored in the `$PATH` environment variable to determine where the OS should look for executables. If multiple executables share the same name, the first binary that's found in the user's `$PATH` is the one that will be executed.

1. Use `which ls` to show the binary that's executed by default
2. Use `find / -iname ls 2>/dev/null` to search for any files matching the name 'ls' (and suppress errors).
3. The wrong `/usr/local/bin/ls` binary appears to be taking precedence over `/bin/ls`.
4. Simply run `/bin/ls` to solve the challenge.

## Answer
Execute `/bin/ls`.
