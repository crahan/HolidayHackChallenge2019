## Resources
- *"On Linux, a user's shell is determined by the contents of /etc/passwd"*  
- *"sudo -l says I can run a command as root. What does it do?"* 

## Solution
![Nyan Shell](../img/hints/h8/h8_terminal1.png)

When you try to log in as Alabaster using `su alabaster_snowball` you'll end up with a Nyan cat animation you can't exit from. Follow the steps listed below to replace Alabaster's current shell with a copy of `/bin/bash`.

1. `grep -i alabaster /etc/passwd`: show Alabaster's default shell.
2. `ls -l /bin/nsh`: show file permissions. `-rwxrwxrwx` means anyone can read/write/execute.
3. `lsattr /bin/nsh`: show file attributes. `i` means the immutable flag is set.
4. `sudo -l`: show commands we can run with elevated privileges. In this case `sudo chattr`.
5. `sudo chattr -i /bin/nsh`: remove the immutable flag on `/bin/nsh` so it can be overwritten.
6. `cp /bin/bash /bin/nsh`: replace Nyan Shell with Bash.
7. `su alabaster_snowball`: log in as alabaster_snowball.
