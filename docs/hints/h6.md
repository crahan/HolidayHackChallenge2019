## Solution
![Keypad](../img/hints/h6/h6_terminal1_yeeaaah.png)

Based on the hints and the keypad image we see that 1, 3, 7, and 'enter' are the keys that are used most frequently. Since one of the 3 digits is also repeated once the total code has a length of 4. This limits the options to [permutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) of the following 3 number sets: [1, 1, 3, 7], [1, 3, 3, 7], and [1, 3, 7, 7]. Finally our 4-digit number needs to be prime. To help solve this we can use the following `find-code.py` Python script.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Tangle Coalbox Frosty Keypad challenge."""
import itertools


def is_prime(number):
    """Verify if a number is a prime."""
    return 2 in [number, 2**number % number]


digit_sets = [
    ['1', '1', '3', '7'],
    ['1', '3', '3', '7'],
    ['1', '3', '7', '7']
]

primes = []

for digits in digit_sets:
    for subset in itertools.permutations(digits):
        val = int(''.join(subset))
        if is_prime(val) and val not in primes:
            primes.append(val)
            print(f'{val} is a prime number')
```

The script generates a manageable list of 5 numbers.

```
1373 is a prime number
1733 is a prime number
3137 is a prime number
3371 is a prime number
7331 is a prime number
```

Still requires 5 attempts to get to the correct code, but [we're finally in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uW47jWLMiY)!

## Answer
Code: `7331`.
