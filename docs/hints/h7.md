## Solution

Start by looking at the HTML source code for some hints about each difficulty level.

![Valid Code](../img/hints/h7/h7_terminal1.png)

### Easy

To solve the challenge on 'easy' start the game, click on `easy`, then click on `buy` (no need to make any changes to your inventory), change the `distance` parameter in the URL to whatever value covers the remaining distance, and press `<enter>`.

On the next screen the `distance` value should have decreased.

Now press the `Go` button.

Tadaaaa! *"Your party has succeeded!"*

### Medium

Solving the challenge on 'medium' really isn't all that different. Instead of manipulating the `distance` in the URL we now change the `distance` value in the HTML body. Click on `medium`, then click the `buy` button, open up your browser's developer tools, and edit the value of the input tag named `distance`.

Press the `Go` button.

And once again, *"Your party has succeeded!"*
