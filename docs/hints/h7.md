## Solution

Start by looking at the HTML source code for some hints about each difficulty level.

![Valid Code](../img/hints/h7/h7_terminal1.png)

### Easy

![Valid Code](../img/hints/h7/h7_terminal2.png)

To solve the challenge on 'easy' start the game, click on `easy`, then click on `buy` (no need to make any changes to your inventory), change the `distance` parameter in the URL to something over 8000 and press the arrow button to the right.

On the next screen the `distance` value should have decreased. Press `Go`.

Tadaaaa! *"Your party has succeeded!"*

### Medium

![Valid Code](../img/hints/h7/h7_terminal5.png)

Solving this on 'medium' difficulty really isn't all that different. The `distance` parameter is just stored and transmitted in a different way than before. Instead of manipulating the URL (GET request) we now change the values in the HTML body (POST request). Click on `medium`,  then click on `buy` (again, no need to make any changes to your inventory), open up your browser's developer tools, edit the value of the input tag named `distance`, and press `Go`.

And once again, *"Your party has succeeded!"*

## Answer
- Easy: change the `distance` GET parameter in the URL.
- Medium: change the `distance` POST parameter in the HTML body.
