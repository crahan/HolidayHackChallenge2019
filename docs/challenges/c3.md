Hint: [Bushy Evergreen - "Escape Ed"](../hints/h3.md)

## Question
*"We're seeing attacks against the Elf U domain! Using the [event log data](https://downloads.elfu.org/Security.evtx.zip), identify the user account that the attacker compromised using a password spray attack. Bushy Evergreen is hanging out in the train station and may be able to help you out."*

## Resources
- [Event log data](https://downloads.elfu.org/Security.evtx.zip)
- [DeepBlueCLI Github](https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI)
- [DeepBlueCLI: a PowerShell Module for Hunt Teaming via Windows Event Logs](https://www.ericconrad.com/2016/09/deepbluecli-powershell-module-for-hunt.html)

## Solution
1. Clone the [DeepBlueCLI](https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI) GitHub repo
2. `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`
3. `.\DeepBlue.ps1 .\Security.evtx`
4. Output shows 3 entries stating 'Multiple admin logons for one account':
   - pminstix
   - supatree
   - dsparkleleaves
5. Only one of these 3 also has an entry indicating the account was sprayed:
   
```shell

High number of logon failures for one account
Security
4672

```
