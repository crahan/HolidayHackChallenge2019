## Hint
> Hello there! I’m Krampus Hollyfeld.  
> I maintain the steam tunnels underneath Elf U,  
> Keeping all the elves warm and jolly.  
> Though I spend my time in the tunnels and smoke,  
> In this whole wide world, there's no happier bloke!  
> Yes, I borrowed Santa’s turtle doves for just a bit.  
> Someone left some scraps of paper near that fireplace, which is a big fire hazard.  
> I sent the turtle doves to fetch the paper scraps.  
> But, before I can tell you more, I need to know that I can trust you.  
> Tell you what – if you can help me beat the Frido Sleigh contest (Objective 8), then I'll know I can trust you.  
> The contest is here on my screen and at [fridosleigh.com](https://fridosleigh.com/).  
> No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want, so I am!  
> They set up the rules, and lately, I have come to realize that I have certain materialistic, cookie needs.  
> Unfortunately, it's restricted to elves only, and I can't bypass the CAPTEHA.  
> (That's Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Elves and Humans Apart.)  
> I've already cataloged [12,000 images](https://downloads.elfu.org/capteha_images.tar.gz) and decoded the [API interface](https://downloads.elfu.org/capteha_api.py).  
> Can you help me bypass the CAPTEHA and submit lots of entries?
