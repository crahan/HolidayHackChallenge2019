# Talk to Santa & Find the Turtle Doves
**Hint**: none

## Request
> This is a little embarrassing, but I need your help.  
> Our KringleCon turtle dove mascots are missing!  
> They probably just wandered off.  
> Can you please help find them?  
> To help you search for them and get acquainted with KringleCon, I’ve created some objectives for you.  
> You can see them in your badge.  
> Where's your badge? Oh! It's that big, circle emblem on your chest - give it a tap!  
> We made them in two flavors - one for our new guests, and one for those who've attended both KringleCons.  
> After you find the Turtle Doves and complete objectives 2-5, please come back and let me know.  
> Not sure where to start? Try hopping around campus and talking to some elves.  
> If you help my elves with some quicker problems, they'll probably remember clues for the objectives.

> Gosh, I can’t help but think:
