# Determine Attacker Technique
**Terminal Hint**: [SugarPlum Mary - Linux Path](../hints/h4.md)

## Request
> Using these [normalized Sysmon logs](https://downloads.elfu.org/sysmon-data.json.zip), identify the tool the attacker used to retrieve domain password hashes from the lsass.exe process. For hints on achieving this objective, please visit Hermey Hall and talk with SugarPlum Mary.

## Solution
We could install EQL to query the normalized Sysmon logs and find the tool that was used to retrieve the domain password hashes from `lsass.exe`. Fortunately for us though the log only contains a handful of different types of commands. If we grep for lines containing `command_line` but exclude the ones containing `wevtutil`, `net  use`, and `powershell` only five remain.

```shell
grep command_line sysmon-data.json | grep -Evi '(powershell|net\s*use|wevtutil)'
```

MITRE ATT&CK technique [T1003](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/) covers credential dumping and provides an overview of some of the commonly used tools. One of the ways to retrieve password hashes in a Windows domain setup is to use the Windows builtin `ntdsutil.exe` command line tool to grab a copy of the main Active Directory database file (i.e. [NTDS.dit](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/servergeeks/2014/10/14/active-directory-files-and-their-functions/)), which is exactly what our attacker did.

## Answer
Tool: `ntdsutil`

## Response
None
